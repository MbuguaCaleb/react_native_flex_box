**Flex Box React Native**

```
By default in react native, every view uses flexbox.

This is slightly different from the web.

By default it organises by the column, unlike in the web which is in a row

Mobile-Column


Not unless i assign  the width and the height, my flexbox will only take the width that
it has to...


Align-items arranges the elements across the cross-axis

Align items is by default set to stretch..

(occupiees the whole height if row was set)
Justify-content arranges the elements along the main axis.

For the main axis when assigning widths i must do that on the chidren

For the cross axis i must do that on the Parent.

I Can have fex box as well in my react native child views.

This is really powerful for saving time and centering my content.
